Learned about injection vulnerabilities. Learned how to identify and differentiate SQL and XSS injection vulnerabilities within a test environment.

The webpage represents a mock version of the Replicants database where you can create and test several SQL queries.

On the left side of this page is the Schema SQL panel, which builds the mock database for Replicants. Do not modify any of the data within this section.

On the right side of the page is the Query SQL panel, which contains the steps to complete the activity, as well as where the queries are modified.
